The application is a Python-based Streamlit app developed using the Roboflow platform's API. The dataset, ApplePlum BD, was pre-processed through Roboflow to streamline the data preparation process. Leveraging deep learning techniques, the app is designed to detect various growth stages of plums, including flower, bud, early fruit, mature fruit, and ripened stages. This web-based application provides an intuitive interface for users to analyze and classify plum growth stages efficiently.
